The other day on London's Oxford Street , as I was pulled by my fiancee into every clothing store imaginable, I couldn't help but notice that every single one of them dedicated the ground floor to women shoppers.  The men's sections were almost always upstairs or downstairs.  Mentioning this to my fiancee, she simply stated the obvious - women shop more.
