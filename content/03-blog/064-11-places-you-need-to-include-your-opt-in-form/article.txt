<blockquote>Just a side-note to say that Janine and Co. look to be doing really well - I used to compete with them when I worked at Campaigner and it seems they've fully embraced blogging culture, proven by their consistent 1st place prize for 'best business/marketing blog' in ClickZ's yearly awards.  If only I could say the same for my previous employer!...</blockquote>
<h3>11 Places You Need To Include Your Opt-In Form</h3>
<strong>Your Homepage</strong> - If you don't have one on your home page, get one there now.

<strong>Your Sub-pages</strong> - All of them! If you don't have the space to put an actual form on all of your sub-pages, at least have a "Newsletter Sign Up" link on them.

<strong>Your Blog</strong> - Not everyone subscribes to RSS to get information from your blog, so you'll need to include an actual form for your readers to sign up, or a "Sign Up For Our Newsletter" link to it. You don't want to lose the opportunity to get email addresses from people who might be interested in knowing about your regular updates. If you use TypePad, you can get the free <a href="http://www.verticalresponse.com/products/typepad-widget.html" target="_blank">VR Opt-in Form Widget</a> with just a few clicks.

<strong>Your Purchase Confirmation Page</strong> - Someone has just hopefully had a great experience purchasing from you, why not ask them to join your list right then and there?

<strong>A Pop-up Window</strong> - Include a pop-up window when someone leaves your website. You won't be able to use this with visitors who have their browsers set to block them, but you'll surely get some people seeing them. We've had thousands of people signing up through this form.

<strong>A Landing Page</strong> - If you have a separate landing page you send people to from your search engine pay-per-click campaigns, include a newsletter sign up form on it. If they don't purchase from you, they might at least sign up to your list, then you'll be able to attempt to get them to purchase later on.

<strong>The Footer of all Outbound Email Correspondence </strong>- Any email you personally send or any email your employees or customer service people send one on one, should have the link to your opt-in form.

<strong>Your Email Marketing Campaigns</strong> - We have many customers that include an opt-in form image or link inside their actual email marketing campaigns. If the email is forwarded to someone who isn't on your list you might get a new subscriber. You can also use Forward to a Friend links as well.

<span style="color: #ff3300;"><strong>Offline</strong></span>

<strong>Your Counter</strong> - Don't forget to put a sign up book at your counter or somewhere prominent in your place of business. Then enter those email addresses quickly and send them a welcome email.

<strong>Taking Appointments</strong> - If your service business is centered around making appointments with your clients, ask them for their email addresses so you can confirm the times. Also ask if they would want offers from you and make a note of their answer.

<strong>Your Tradeshow Table</strong> - You've spent a lot of money to be at a tradeshow. If someone doesn't have a business card you don't want to lose the opportunity to add them to your list. So make sure you have some kind of sign up form or book at your booth.
