<p class="beitrag">Barack Obamaâ€™s recent email on the campaign trail reflects a few themes in email marketing:
- Transparency (showing that the donation site is an secure link, instead of hiding it in HTML)
- Writing for Gmail- leveraging access to AdWords, and working with the severe HTML restrictions
- Writing email content as a web page- taking advantage of intertextuality
