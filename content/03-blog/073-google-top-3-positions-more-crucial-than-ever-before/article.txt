After fitting 30 participants with what I assume to be the crazy Clockwork Orange-style headkit, the searchers viewed a Google SERP for the term 'Oasis'.
<blockquote>Anyone who works in SEO or SEM... Your job just got harder.</blockquote>

Basically, when compared to the results for the same search term from 2005, Think Eyetracking have found that the way we use Google SERPs has changed drastically in the last 3 years.  Whereas 3 years ago eyeball-tracking showed searchers viewing the entire first page, today searchers are looking at the top 3 results <em>only</em>.

Some very interesting stats generated from this experiment:
<ul>
	<li class="content">The top 3 Google results get <strong>79%</strong> of all clicks</li>
	<li class="content"><strong>86%</strong> of the participants would alter the search query if they didn't find what they wanted... and assumes they would continue doing this until the desired result entered the top 3 </li>
	<li class="content"><strong>97%</strong> of the participants used Google as their primary SE</li>
	<li class="content"><strong>87%</strong> said they wouldn't bother using another SE (!)</li>
</ul>
