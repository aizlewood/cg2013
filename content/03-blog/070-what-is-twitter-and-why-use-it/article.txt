In the spirit of this marketing blog, this article will explore what Twitter is, what and who it’s for, and why you should start to use it as part of your ever-growing marketing mix.

<h3>What is it? </h3>
Don’t you just love buzzwords? Micro-blogging (Twitter’s official definition) and social networking are combined in Twitter, allowing a user to send snippets of their everyday life in 140 characters or less to a loyal group of followers.  If it sounds odd/useless/a waste of time, it’s really not – just ask the 2.2 million registered users of Twitter who use it, including big names like <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BarackObama ">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BBC">the BBC,</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bbcnews">BBC News</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/guardiannews">the Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com/twitter">Dell</a>, and many more.

<h3>What’s it for? </h3>
Anything you want it to be.  Twitter doesn’t have to be all about business, nor does it have to be all about your daily habits and routines.  What it does innately is increase your transparency as a corporate or personal brand and allow you to open up to those following you (or searching for you).  Twitter offers user insight that even blogs can’t offer due to its 1) 140 character limit - enforcing succinctness, and 2) following concept, where you can follow anyone using the service that interests you.  Interested in Web Design? Use the Twitter Search and follow anyone discussing Wordpress or CSS.  Love Food? Search and follow.

<h3>Who’s it for?</h3>
If you read my last post on Gladwell’s 3 agents of change, you’ll likely fall into one of the 3 types, otherwise you wouldn’t be here, right? Although it’s currently full of a savvy tech crowd who are hungry for information, news, events, tricks, new posts, and interacting with one another, Twitter is open to anyone who wants to ‘get connected’.  Following on the example above with Barack Obama using Twitter, just look at his measly 65k followers and you can be pretty certain that 75% of them aren’t fanatical tech-heads!

<h3>Me + Twitter</h3>
As far as early adoption goes, I’m embarrassed to say I was a bit narrow-minded with Twitter.  I roughly understood the concept, but felt daunted and annoyed by the thought of updating what really is a Facebook status message with mundane information about my life.  What was worse was assuming people whom I’ve never met even cared what I did last night or what TV show I was watching.

But, fast-forward 60 days, and I’m a true Twitter believer.  Diving into the Tweetiverse and meeting all the Tweeple (OK, I’ll stop the cheese), I started to appreciate what it is, what it does, and ironically how it fills a void that I never knew needed filling.  The thing is, when you think about it, haven’t most of today’s successful ideas created something that no one realized they needed until it was actually created?  By creating a virtual demand and being the only supplier, Twitter has most definitely set the scene for creating their own tipping point.
