<h2><a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2007/01/31/outlook-2007-part-ii/">Outlook 2007, Part II</a></h2>
<img src="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/nhs/images/outlook.jpg" alt="Outlook 2007" align="left"/>As a daily email marketer who frequently designs, programs and sends email marketing campaigns, Outlook 2007’s apparent step in the wrong direction had me pretty up in arms for many reasons. As a recap for my initial post, Outlook looks set to take a few steps back down the evolutionary staircase and use Microsoft Word as its HTML email-rendering engine. Not IE7. Not IE6 even. But Word. What does this mean? That campaigns that look great now in our inboxes won’t look good come February to those running Outlook 2007.  <a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2007/01/31/outlook-2007-part-ii/"  class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2008/09/07/25-great-marketing-oriented-web-designs/">25 Great Marketing-Oriented Web Designs</a></h2>
<img src="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/tactica-300x127.gif" alt="25 designs" align="left"/>Although website design is (in my opinion) one of the most hotly-contested environments on the web right now, most of the beautiful websites you see on various CSS galleries are single-service, offering either web design or web design/development by use of a graphical portfolio. Here I’ve rounded up the other folk – the SMBs or one-man teams offering multiple services centered around web marketing, including such ninja-like disciplines as PPC, SEO, email marketing, and of course effective web design.

So here are the top 25 websites that combine beautiful design with various web marketing services (not just web design).  <a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2008/09/07/25-great-marketing-oriented-web-designs/"  class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2008/10/03/the-longtail-rule-aka-the-80-20-rule-is-everywhere/">The Longtail Rule (aka the 80-20 rule) is everywhere!</a></h2>
<img src="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/longtail.jpg" alt="Longtail" align="left"/>Ever notice how certain things you do at your day job seem to integrate themselves into your everday life? A perfect example is the Pareto Principle, otherwise known as the 80-20 rule, the Longtail, the Zipf law or the Power Law. Whatever you know it as, it has become very well known to the internet industry due to the www’s ability to offer greater choice and inventory than previously possible in a brick and mortar store. For the sake of this article, I’ll be referring to the Pareto principle as the Longtail rule.  <a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/notebook/2008/10/03/the-longtail-rule-aka-the-80-20-rule-is-everywhere/"  class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a>
