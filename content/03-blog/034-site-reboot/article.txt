CarbonGraffiti has had a facelift!

Why?  Because having an all-HTML site starts to become a burden when you want to make quick updates, and especially when those updates are of the blog nature.  This new site is built on the now famous Wordpress.org platform, meaning I can make updates quickly and from any browser.  I think I'm the definition of Wordpress' (very successful) adoption strategy - want to blog, start on Wordpress.com, buy custom CSS (for $15), demand more freedom, consider Wordpress.org, tinker with Wordpress.org, pay for domain transfer ($10), use Wordpress.org, love Wordpress.org.

So, as for the site - new look, new feel.  I love the aurora effect, too bad considering it's just got some attention, but I assure all of you that this site design was purely a coincidence!

Hope you like it, if yes (or no), let me know!
