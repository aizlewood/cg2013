Much to my dismay, after trying to get my own <a href="http://www.carbongraffiti.com/emailmarketing/emailtemplates.html" title="Email Marketing templates" target="_blank">Free Email Marketing Templates page</a> dugg on Digg (and getting a measly 3 diggs), I saw Campaign Monitor get <strong>way </strong>up there on the first page of Digg with their page of <em>30 </em>free templates.  Great for them.
