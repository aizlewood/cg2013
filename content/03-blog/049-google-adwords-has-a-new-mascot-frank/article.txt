Over on their blog <a title="Frank the Hand turkey" href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2008/04/introducing-frankrank-new-ad-ranking.html" target="_self">they've just announced that Frank the Hand Turkey is officially the new GAW mascot</a> (complete with new bowtie), and with his new position comes great responsibility.  He knows this, and has already started pushing his weight around by introducing a new ranking algorithm - FrankRank(TM).

It looks like Frank is set to become the new cock of the walk at Google, and I wish him the best of luck, and look forward to hearing more about him!
