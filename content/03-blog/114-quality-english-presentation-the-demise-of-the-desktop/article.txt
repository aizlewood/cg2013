In early November, <a href="quality-english.com">Quality English</a> were kind enough to Eurostar me down to Paris to present to their member schools on digital marketing.

The presentation, entitled '<strong>The demise of the desktop: Digital marketing and the mobile web</strong>' is now hosted on Slideshare, as well as embedded below. 

<h3>Here's the write up for the presentation:</h3>

"<em>In today's digital economy, international students are finding and interacting with your information in a multitude of ways... and perhaps most importantly via a wide array of devices. Evolving from the desktop to the mobile and/or tablet device represents a fundamental shift in how users are interacting with your websites and digital marketing campaigns.

This presentation will explore the wide variety of ways in which you can tap into this mobile movement by examining new and existing digital marketing channels as well as design best practices and guidelines. From basic SEM and email marketing channels to responsive design and online/offline integration, this presentation will leave you with fresh, new marketing ideas to consider and renewed confidence when moving into the mobile space.
