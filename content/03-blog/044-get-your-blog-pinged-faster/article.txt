Have a new blog on Wordpress.org that you want indexed ASAP?  Make sure you’re pinging!

By pinging the set of URLs below, you can notify blog directories and search engines like Google that you’ve just updated your blog.  The more you post, the more you’re pinged, and the more you’re pinged, the more traffic you get. If you use Google Alerts, you probably already know that this service might be one of the most understated methods of generating qualified traffic to any site, so make sure that, if nothing else, you’re pinging the Google Blog service.
