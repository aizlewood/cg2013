So what can you do to better target your potential customers?

Imagine <strong>store mannequins</strong>.  Retailers use them to display the newest clothing lines, effectively turning the mannequin into a representation of their target audience. Take a leaf out of the retailers book and <strong>build a virtual mannequin that represents your audience</strong>.  Address and identify the main demographic information - how old are they? Are they primarily one gender or the other? Next identify their <strong>common traits</strong> - where do they shop, where do they hang out, where do they interact with one another?  Continue to build up the overall characteristics of your virtual mannequin and get as <strong>specific </strong>as you like - <strong>the more specific the better</strong>.  Look through your previous customer details, past transactions, survey responses, email campaigns, buzz monitoring results, and more, to build a comprehensive idea of what your <strong>ideal customer</strong> looks like.

Once you get an idea for their behaviour, go a step further and give your virtual mannequin a name, a personal style, a back story, and anything else that helps your model become more 'real'.  You'll be amazed at how differently you look at your future campaigns when you have an <strong>actual face and a name</strong> to market to, not just an email address or PID (person id).
