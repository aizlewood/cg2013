I for one couldn’t be happier, and think they are doing a fantastic job with their new initiative.

It’s called the <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/" title="Email Standards Project" target="_blank">Email Standards Project</a>; its aim: to create a universal standard for email design, akin to the existing universal Web Standards that every web designer adheres religiously to, so that we can all code faster, easier and better HTML emails that will work across all email clients.
