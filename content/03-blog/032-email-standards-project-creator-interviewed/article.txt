Go check out <a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com" title="Email Marketing Reports" target="_blank">email-marketing-reports</a>, where David Greiner, the initiator of the Email Standards Project, gets <a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com/iland/2007/11/html-email-standards-big-interview.html" title="David Greiner Interview" target="_blank">interviewed</a> and gives his take on why the Standards project was made and what it’s for.

One of the highlights of the interview has to be the hint that one of the email client industry’s key players (such as MS, Yahoo, Google, Lotus, etc) have already approached David and his team to get more information on the ESP and, hopefully, are willing to do something about it.
