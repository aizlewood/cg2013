Wordpress have just released their 2.5 version, which is an all-rounder of an upgrade - new interface design, new functionalities, new everything.  <strong>But </strong>unfortunately it also means that there are some serious growing pains.  For instance my entire portfolio section seems to be fubar'd from the upgrade, and I'm trying my hardest to fix it.  So for those of you who are finding sections of this site to be a bit 'wonky', please excuse them, and be sure that they'll be fixed ASAP!
