On January 27th I gave an hour-long talk on 'The Future of Digital Marketing', speaking specifically to the ELT (English Language Training) industry.  The conference was put on by EnglishUK and described as follows:

"<em>The English UK Marketing Conference, organised by the English Language Promotions Group (ELPG), hosted by UKTI and supported by Cambridge ESOL is an important forum for professionals who are involved in the marketing of English language and other courses to international students.</em>"

I'm happy to say my talk went down a storm, based on the feedback I received at the conference and thereafter.
