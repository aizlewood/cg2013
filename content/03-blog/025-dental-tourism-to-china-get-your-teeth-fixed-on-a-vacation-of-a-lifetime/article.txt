I’ve just finished another client’s website - <a href="http://www.incidentaltourist.com/" title="http://www.incidentaltourist.com">http://www.incidentaltourist.com</a> - and I expect good things from it.  The interesting part about the website is the content itself; Dental Tourism is an interesting industry, but <a href="http://www.incidentaltourist.com/dentaltourism.html" title="Dental Tourism">Dental Tourism</a> to China is pretty bold and new.  My client has already had success with Canadian InciDental tourists, and hopes for more from all over North America.
