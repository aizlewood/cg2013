<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve since moved to the UK (hence the large gap between this and my last post) to be with the love of my life and fiancée.<span>  </span>Officially, my new location is Brighton, East Sussex, UK, for the next 5 months at least. <span> </span>Leaving the online marketing job I had in Montreal for the past 4 years was tough but invigorating, and I’m now looking forward to seeing what the online and email worlds are like here in England. To experience it I have to find a job first though...</p>
