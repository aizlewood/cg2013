Last week was hell. At my work I'm responsible for the design, implementation, testing and sending of all email marketing communications sent to customers and prospects.  Although the average size of send is small due to list segmentation and targeting, a send can range anywhere from 10 to 100,000 contacts.  As I've already sent dozens of email blasts and communications in the past, that day last week was was no different - except that I was clearly overtired, overworked, had my mind elsewhere, and quite frankly a bit bored.
