<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/experimentsindigitalcreativity/">87 cool things</a></strong> that, from their perspective, was stuff 'worth knowing about'. 

In a nutshell if any or all of the slides happen to give you goosebumps, put a smile on your face, or just simply make you go 'wow', it's pretty obvious that:

<ul>
	<li>a) If you're already in the web industry, you're in the right industry</li>
	<li>b) If you're not already in the web industry, you sure wouldn't mind being in it</li>
	<li>c) Technology, innovation and the rampant growth of the web is something to get excited about, no matter how you look at it</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/experimentsindigitalcreativity/">Check out the '87 cool things' slideshow</a>, you won't be disappointed.
