I haven't noticed a banner ad for a really, really long time now, so I was pretty impressed when I came across the newest series of 'Get a Mac' banner ads by Apple.  It's a great use of the 728x90 real estate and Flash, and of course the Mac Ad sense of humour draws you in and makes you want to watch it again, and click.
