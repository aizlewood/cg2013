In the meantime however, I thought I'd announce a new side project that has finally seen the light of day.  Introducing <strong>The Email Design Gallery</strong> at <a href="http://emaildesigngallery.com">http://emaildesigngallery.com</a>.  I created this gallery as a showcase for all of the fantastic email designs out there, specifically as a way to help get the medium of email design more widely-recognized across the web community.


<blockquote>...besides simple design aesthetics, the EDG strives to underline the importance, creativity and hard work required for good email design by underlining the importance of standards-compliant code. With many web-based and desktop-based email clients to account for – all dramatically ranging in their rendering capabilities – email designers & coders are continually challenged to design for an often inhospitable medium.</blockquote>


<blockquote>With designs ranging from retail giants to boutique agencies – and everything in between – email design is slowly shedding the unfortunate title of web design’s ugly sibling and becoming a thriving design community onto itself – complete with its own set of guidelines, standards, pitfalls and best practices.</blockquote>



Go have a visit and browse the current entries (all hand-selected of course).  If you feel you've got a kick-ass email design that ought to be there, feel free to tag the creative on Twitter with the hashtag '#theedg' (or contact directly via <a href="http://twitter.com/theedg">http://twitter.com/theedg</a>), or simply opt for the traditional way using the site's submission form.

Hope to see you soon!
