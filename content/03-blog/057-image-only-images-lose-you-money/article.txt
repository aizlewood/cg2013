Apple, are you listening? According to a survey by the EEC (<a title="EEC" href="http://www.the-dma.org/cgi/disppressrelease?article=1158">Email Experience Council</a>) and reported by <a title="the DMA" href="http://www.the-dma.org/cgi/disppressrelease?article=1158">The DMA</a>, most retail email marketers (57%) are still sending image-only or heavy image-based email campaigns to their subscribers.  Interesting considering the fact that image-based campaigns are known to trigger higher spam scores and reduce open rates based on their large size and, of course, don't get seen if images are turned 'off' in the email client.


Jeanniey Mullen, who you might recognize from her countless ClickZ articles on email marketing (and who's also the founder and exec chairwoman of the EEC) states that:
<blockquote>Email marketing currently generates an estimated return on investment of <strong>$48.29 for every dollar spent</strong> on it, according to the Direct Marketing Association

We conservatively estimate that if all marketers optimized their emails for image blocking, <strong>email’s ROI would jump to $52.69</strong>. Not paying attention to rendering impacts revenue directly.</blockquote>
Although it might not seem like much on paper, that $4.40 uplift per sale can add up to a tidy profit, and truly begs the question why huge multinational retailers like Apple are continuing to use image-only email campaigns for their promotional campaigns.

Here are some more noteworthy stats on image-only email campaigns - if anything these should sway you from ever even experimenting with <a title="Image only email campaigns - dont" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carbongraffiti.com%2F2007%2F02%2F11%2Fimage-only-email-marketing-campaigns-just-dont-do-it%2F&amp;ei=sChQSKSBA6iU0wS1j8n0Cg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFog5dJGyiQsUvS9zf0jiV3p3eSyQ&amp;sig2=w-Of-M25-4th5NuDmvkK3w">image-only campaigns - just don't!</a>

	<li>Text in banners</li>
	<li>Lists (upcoming releases, etc.)</li>
	<li>Menu and navigation bar text</li>
	<li>Call-to-action buttons</li>

</ul>

	<li>The emails from only 21% of retailers displayed meaningful snippet text.</li>
</ul>
