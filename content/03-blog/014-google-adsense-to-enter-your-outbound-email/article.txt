According to <a href="http://www.chadmauldin.com/blog/2007/04/24/google-ads-go-a-little-further/" title="Chad Mauldin">Chad Mauldin</a>:

<em>'Google recently filed for a new patent, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=3&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=google.ASNM.&amp;OS=an/google&amp;RS=AN/google" id="a_5" title="Google Patent">here</a>, on technology to display ads in email. Some may disregard this, seeing as Google already displays ads inside of Gmail,  but this is somewhat different.  This is Adwords for email, essentially allowing anyone to place Adsense inside of their outgoing mail, specifically mentioned in the patent, newsletters.</em>

<em>What impact will this have? This will allow advertisers to target certain websites email newsletters, provide publishers on more avenue for revenue, and with that provide Google with an even broader reach. Imagine opening your yahoo/msn/hotmail/any mail account and seeing Google branding and ads.'</em>

The more relevant questions are... how was this not going to happen eventually (I can definitely imagine seeing ads in my hotmail/yahoo/msn account), and are Google pretty much on course to dominate your entire online life?  (... and maybe <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/11/google-plans-street-advertising-presence/" title="Google World Domination">your physical world too</a>?)

This might be well-timed though, considering Outlook 2007's inability to show rotating gif's/banner ads in email, Adsense might put money in advertiser's pockets and see the banner ad go the way of the dodo.
