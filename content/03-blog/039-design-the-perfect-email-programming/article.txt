Part 7 of a 10 step series, here's a quick tip on how to program your perfect email campaign.

Programming:

No CSS in the <head></head> of your email code. Gmail and Outlook 2007 support CSS very poorly
Keep all CSS inline only
Code entire email in HTML 4 tables for best results across all email clients
No background or tiled background images.
Use ALT text on all images for those recipients with image blocking set ‘on’ by default
Height and width defined in HTML for all images
No JavaScript, flash, or embedded media
Always test layout in multiple email clients, as dictated by primary customer demographic
