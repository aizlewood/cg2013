<p>How do <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624">Malcolm Gladwell’s ‘The Tipping Point’</a> come together? If you’ve read the book, you’ll know that a tipping point is established when the momentum of a service, product or idea becomes so great that it reaches a type of critical mass, ultimately becoming a part of a mainstream society for any period of time.<br /><br />
Twitter seems to be approaching its own Tipping point, as seen by the various growing pains it has encountered lately, including unplanned outages and a rethink on their free SMS service for Europe [link].  As they become a victim of their own success, the simple, easy-to-use and highly addictive web service is quickly gaining notoriety as a new way of reaching, engaging and interacting with like-minded peers or customers.  </p>
<p>Ironically, Twitter is also proving to be a platform for facilitating other tipping points, due in no small part to its ability to connect Gladwell’s 3 agents of change - Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen – to build momentum for other ideas, products and services.</p>
<h3>Which one are you?</h3>
<p>Twitter seems to be tailor-made for the agents of change described by Gladwell.  In my Twitter account alone (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Aizlewood">www.twitter.com/Aizlewood</a>), I’m already well aware who of the 54 Tweeters I’m following fall into one of the 3 categories: </p>
<ul>
<li class="content">There are most definitely the <strong>Connectors </strong>- those who simply tweet about interesting topics, events and new blog posts.  Without these Tweeters, I wouldn’t know who’s just published a post on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5gf5tk">Tracking iPhone visits</a>, or ever know about a great app called <a href="http://oliveapp.com/">Olive</a>.</li>
<li class="content">Then there are the <strong>Mavens </strong>– the ‘information specialists’ who bring new ideas, new technologies, mash-ups and various other tech-fu to our insatiable appetites.  Without this select bunch, I would never know about particular Wordpress hacks and great ideas like <a href="http://rohitbhargava.typepad.com/weblog/2008/07/the-rise-of-ego.html">Egommunication</a>.</li>
<li class="content">Then, of course there are the <strong>Salesmen </strong>– the Tweeters who brazenly market and promote their services, products and solutions, at least in a round-about way, to the Twitterverse.  These guys speak for themselves, and using the same example of <a href="http://oliveapp.com/">Olive</a>, I would never have downloaded the free version with intention to buy!</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have these 3 basic ingredients for creating a Tipping point, Twitter has, either intentional or not, created a fertile land of allowing the smart marketer to start & maintain the momentum for their product or service.  By harnessing the power of gathering like-minded enthusiasts in one place and forcing them to talk as often as possible, the opportunity to start and engage in conversations about something particular is better than ever.  </p>
<p>The next article will address what Twitter is, who it’s for, and why use it. Stay tuned!</p>
