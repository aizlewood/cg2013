Their mantra is ‘don’t be evil’ right? Isn’t transparency Google’s middle name?

So why is it that after installing a real-time site tracking tool (statcounter.com) to my PPC landing pages, I see several (50-60%) of all inbound, paid clicks being referred from websites or pages of questionable quality?  Did I mention that, as always, my content network option is most definitely set to ‘off’?


I understand it’s a relatively well-known issue that the quality of Google’s search network varies from the very good, geared-for-the-long-tail engines like ask.com and dogpile, to the very iffy ‘engines’ that includes the internal search function of random sites like ‘howstuffworks’ and ‘dealtime.com’, but why don’t we as advertisers get better control?  As the advertiser, I know my audience best, what SE’s and countries they prefer, and which converts the best.  So if we pay for each and every click, shouldn’t we get better control over where our ads actually display?

Unfortunately opting-out of the search and content network in Google PPC can reduce overall impressions (and clicks) by at least 75%, whereas leaving them opted-in delivers a whole lot more clicks at much less quality… so where’s the compromise?   Why can’t Google openly list their Search network partners and allow us to opt-in (and out) of select search partners based on statistical analysis of where our ads perform best?  Wouldn’t that be a better move to enforce their famous mantra, rather than <a title="Google Search Network" href="https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6119&amp;ctx=tltp">offer great graphics on the current crop of (select) search network partners</a>?

I know it’s all about the revenue for Google, and that the search and content networks complete the SEM pie, but it’s a bitter pill to swallow when realizing (and confirming) that the transparency on offer when using Google Adwords isn’t what you’d expect from the search giant.

My advice? Do a week-on-week test for conversions - one week with the Search network set to on, the next week off.   Chances are, your clicks and impressions will go down dramatically with it turned off, but your quality shouldn't suffer (and hopefully increase).   As a note, it's important to say that PPC always depends on your industry and your audience - some advertisers will appreciate the Search network for what it is, but in my opinion it's never nice to realize you're being duped.
