CarbonGraffiti is proud to be among a growing group of service providers listed on the all-new <a href="http://experts.mailchimp.com/">MailChimp Experts Directory</a>.  Now over 4 weeks old, the Directory is filling up fast, and looks to be the go-to place for thousands of MailChimp customers requiring services ranging from custom email design to API and ecommerce integration.  <strong>Update: CarbonGraffiti is now an official, featured MailChimp expert.  That means people like us, and MailChimp agree.</strong> 

You can <a href="http://experts.mailchimp.com/profile/carbongraffiti">find CarbonGraffiti on the MailChimp Experts Directory</a> filed under Email Design, Consultation, Training and Campaign Management. 

<h3>Also worth mentioning</h3>
Using some good old-fashioned htaccess trickery mixed with this site's new grid layout, I created a new landing page targeting users arriving specifically from the Experts directory.  By tailoring a page specific to their expectations and needs, users get a better experience without being burdened with having to manually find what they're looking for.

For some added flavour I cooked in a CrazyEgg tracking script, which will help tell me where visitors are clicking and more importantly where they're not, as well as a Google Website Optimiser experiment to see whether a green or red CTA button gets the most interest.
