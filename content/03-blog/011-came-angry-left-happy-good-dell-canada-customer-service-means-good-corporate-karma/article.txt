Back in December 2006 I excitedly returned from the <a href="http://www.womma.org" title="WOMMA">WOMMA  </a>conference in D.C., went a bit crazy, and wrote <a href="http://aizlewood.wordpress.com/2006/12/15/my-word-of-mouth-marketing-manifesto/" title="WOM manifesto">a lengthy essay/manifesto</a> in the airport terminal to channel all my thoughts onto paper.  I realized that customer service plays an integral role not only to creating good WoM, but also plays a major role in good corporate karma.  Putting the customer first and making them happy above all else was a great impetus to creating good WOM and building a solid customer base, but after seeing one side of the coin - the theoretical part from the seminars at WOMMA- I was missing the other side where I actually got to experience it.
