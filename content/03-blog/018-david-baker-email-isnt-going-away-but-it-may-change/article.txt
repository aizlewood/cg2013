I'm blatantly syndicating this blog post by <a href="http://whitenoiseinc.com/" title="WhiteNoise">David Baker</a> of <a href="http://www.avenuea-razorfish.com/" title="Razorfish">Avenue A/Razorfish</a> as it does the rounds, because I feel it adroitly simplifies what email marketing should (and might) become in the near future. I saw David speak at a <a href="http://www.womma.org" title="WOMMA">WOMMA </a>conference in 2006, and was as impressed then as I am now with his views and generally 360 grasp on online marketing today.
